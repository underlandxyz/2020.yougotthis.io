    <h2>About You Got This</h2>
    <p>You Got This is a conference for early-career developers about NON-TECHNICAL skills needed for a happy, healthy worklife. In 2019, we had topics around imposter syndrome, managing money, ethics in tech, self care and creating good learning enviornments. </p>
    <p>The event has three audiences: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Folks looking to soon get their first developer role (not just students, also career-changers)</li>
      <li>Junior devs looking to skill-up and grow professionally into their next roles</li>
      <li>Managers and team leaders wanting to know more and better support their team</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>About the talks</h2>
    <p>Talks are all 30 minutes. Identifying information and pronouns will be removed and talks will be reviewed by a panel for selection. There are 6 talks which will be selected from the submitted talks. </p>
    <h2>Reimbursement</h2>
    <p>Speakers will be provided £300 and up to £100 for travel. We'll organise accomodation for the night before the conference. We hope this lowers the barrier of participation for speakers.</p>
    <p>If your business can cover these, we'll put the value of your fee in the Inclusion Programme. </p>
    <h2>Final bits</h2>
    <p>All speakers must abide by our Code of Conduct. </p>
    <p>All speakers will also be offered mentorship around writing and delivering their talk. We welcome new speakers.</p>
    <p>Please don't submit sales pitches for your business or product.</p>
    <p>We are not interested in technical talks. This is a conference about non-technical skills. </p>
