    <h1 id="title">We can offer you a ticket-only scholarship</h1>
    <p>Thank you for applying to receive a full scholarship to You Got This 2020.</p>
    <p>We received quite a lot of applications and had to consider how we could make our small budget stretch to benefit the most people possible. As a result we aren't able to offer you a full scholarship, but we would still love to see you at the event and can offer you a free ticket.</p>
    <p>You can redeem your free ticket until November 31st 2019.</p>

    <p>In return we'd love if you could please share the conference with #YouGotThisConf online to make sure more people know it's happening!</p>
